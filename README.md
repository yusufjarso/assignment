Test Project: To-Do List Manager

Project Description: Create a simple to-do list manager using Python. The program will allow users to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, list tasks, and remove tasks.

Requirements:

Basic User Interface:

Upon starting the program, display a welcome message and a list of available actions: "1. Add Task", "2. Mark Task as Completed", "3. List Tasks", "4. Remove Task", and "5. Quit".

Task List:

Implement a way to store tasks. You can use a list or any other appropriate data structure.

Add Task:

When the user selects the "Add Task" option, prompt them to enter the task description.

Add the task to the task list.

Mark Task as Completed:

Allow the user to mark a task as completed by entering its index in the task list.

If the task is already marked as completed, display an appropriate message.

List Tasks:

Display a numbered list of tasks along with their completion status.

Remove Task:

Allow the user to remove a task by entering its index in the task list.

Quit:

When the user selects the "Quit" option, display a goodbye message and terminate the program.
